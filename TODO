- FIXME: https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/testrewardcourt5/0xdfaeb52cf5ad6a82ca8f9652ae58fbed6472805e/tab/3
  cannot mint token #1 (100 items) to 0xC62ce5310E175fcE50589550AF3e1a4bEDe34077
  (cannot vote "yes").

- FIXME: It does not check intercourt token validity on minting.

- Trust in a separate tab.

- Fix the bug of always using "allEvents" with "external_past_events":
  https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/issues/362
  (Currently solved by distributing aragon.js/ with our software.)

- More roles.

- Automatic recurring (monthly, etc.) transactions.

- Cutting too long strings in controls.

- App initialization function.

- Intercourt transfer in UI.

- Can we optimize by loading only latest court names, not historic ones from Ethereum events?

- Is it possible to change the files in app/public/ every time contracts compile?
  (Report feature request to Aragon if impossible.)
