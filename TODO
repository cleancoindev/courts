- This bug prevents it to work!

- Test in Enjin Wallet (what's about token icons?)

- Fix the bug of always using "allEvents" with "external_past_events":
  https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/issues/362
  (Currently solved by distributing aragon.js/ with our software.)

- More roles.

- Automatic recurring (monthly, etc.) transactions.

- Cutting too long strings in controls.

- App initialization function.

- Intercourt transfer in UI.

- Is it possible to change the files in app/public/ every time contracts compile?
  (Report feature request to Aragon if impossible.)

- Enabling/disabling multiple childs at once.

- More `Carbon` functions.

- Develop (linear or quadratic) voting with vote value being a function of the value
  donated during the vote. It is needed to use M+ token (and local tokens) as the voting
  token, because it is impossible to store the value of M+ at the start of a voting
  period (see https://github.com/vporton/carbon-flow/blob/main/README.md).
  Existing Aragon vote app is not appropriate - fork or modify it.

- Port Aragon to Fuse and then use GoodDollar Identity contract for anti-Sybil when
  quadratic voting.

- Introduce ADMIN role. Admins could be able to disable child tokens without voting
  (to act quickly in the case of a theft).
