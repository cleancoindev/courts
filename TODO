- Test in Enjin Wallet (what's about token icons?)

- Intercourt trust should allow not only minting but also transfering tokens.

- Trust in a separate tab.

- Fix the bug of always using "allEvents" with "external_past_events":
  https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/issues/362
  (Currently solved by distributing aragon.js/ with our software.)

- More roles.

- Automatic recurring (monthly, etc.) transactions.

- Cutting too long strings in controls.

- App initialization function.

- Intercourt transfer in UI.

- Can we optimize by loading only latest court names, not historic ones from Ethereum events?

- Is it possible to change the files in app/public/ every time contracts compile?
  (Report feature request to Aragon if impossible.)
