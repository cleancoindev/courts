- Fix the bug of always using "allEvents" with "external_past_events":
  https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/issues/362

- The top part of the UI is hidden when the vertical window size is small.

- Tabbed UI (split into multiple apps?)

- More roles.

- Automatic recurring (monthly, etc.) transactions.

- Cutting too long strings in controls.

- App initialization function.

- Intercourt transfer in UI.

- UI for new court creation.

- Can we optimize by loading only latest court names, not historic ones from Ethereum events?

- Is it possible to change the files in app/public/ every time contracts compile?
  (Report feature request to Aragon if impossible.)
